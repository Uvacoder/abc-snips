# Motivation 
I lookup various older projects for a certain set of code that I wrote with a certain thought process and instead of re-doing it , I prefer having a reference of such snippets. This can be UI elements, Helper functions or full fledged scripts. Either way, it's easier to have them stored somewhere and this app basically acts as a web app for the same.
