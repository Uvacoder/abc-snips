## Motivation

I lookup various older projects for a certain set of code that I wrote with a certain thought process and instead of re-doing it , I prefer having a reference of such snippets. This can be UI elements, Helper functions or full fledged scripts. Either way, it's easier to have them stored somewhere and this app basically acts as a web app for the same.

## Contribute

The easiest way to contribute to the project is to make a fork of this repository and raise a PR with the needed changes/fixes. Make sure to inform the maintainer about the issue you pick up to avoid any overlaps
